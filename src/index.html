                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I was born in Madrid the 13 of March of 2005, but I have lived since I was 3 up to when I was 18 in Palma de Mallorca, in the Balearic
                    Islands. I had all my education before college thaugth simultaneously in Spanish, Catalan and English, and I am able to speak the three 
                    of them more or less fluently. I had good grades up until the university access exam, the EVAU, where my grades took a hit and I almost 
                    didn't join the university that I wanted. Finally I ended in the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I have studied to years before 
                    coming to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

                <h1>Computer Science</h1>
                <p>I have been a computer science student for 2 years now, and this is my third one. I have experience programing with python and C. 
                    I also have used R, SQL, Risc-V assembly language and VHDL. I haven't had any professional experience yet but some of the projects 
                    that I have done include a Linux shell, a small SQL data base to manage a network of libraries and a small version of the original 
                    Mario videogame.
